# Chatbot-Python
# This is a project made by Paramdeep Singh Gill
I have made a chatbot using python, it has the following features:
1. It can tweet.
2. It can email.
3. It can translate your text (i.e. english) in almost any language.
4. It can search for you on google and print the topmost URLs and can also open the browser it asked.
5. It can stores your passwords and print if asked.
6. Gives output with audio(using gtts).
 
If you want to run this program you can download the folder and then run it on your computer using python IDLE (visit python.org).
